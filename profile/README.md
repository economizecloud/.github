At [Economize](https://www.economize.cloud/index.html), we help companies analyze, manage, and optimize their infrastructure costs & billing better, running on the public cloud.

With the help of Economize, companies can:

- View monthly cost breakdowns for their infrastructure and understand billing much better.
- Optimize their infrastructure usage to reduce costs using segregated component costs that provides better insight than the default billing account.
- Track the utilization and cost visibility to understand cost breakdown at the instance level.
- Get instant alerts and warnings on unusual thresholds and get timely reports for all data in various dimensions.
- Create and manage cloud resources using labels and tags to better organize and filter resources.
